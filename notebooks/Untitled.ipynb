    "A Python Singleton mixin class that makes use of some of the ideas\n",
    "found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonSingleton. Just inherit\n",
    "from it and you have a singleton. No code is required in\n",
    "subclasses to create singleton behavior -- inheritance from \n",
    "Singleton is all that is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Singleton creation is threadsafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "USAGE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just inherit from Singleton. If you need a constructor, include\n",
    "an __init__() method in your class as you usually would. However,\n",
    "if your class is S, you instantiate the singleton using S.getInstance() \n",
    "instead of S(). Repeated calls to S.getInstance() return the \n",
    "originally-created instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class S(Singleton):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, a, b=1):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "S1 = S.getInstance(1, b=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, that's all you need to know. However, there are some\n",
    "other useful behaviors. Read on for a full description:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Getting the singleton:\n",
    "\n",
    "    S.getInstance() \n",
    "    \n",
    "returns the instance of S. If none exists, it is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) The usual idiom to construct an instance by calling the class, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "    S()\n",
    "    \n",
    "is disabled for the sake of clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For one thing, the S() syntax means instantiation, but getInstance()\n",
    "usually does not cause instantiation. So the S() syntax would\n",
    "be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, if S() were allowed, a programmer who didn't \n",
    "happen to notice the inheritance from Singleton (or who\n",
    "wasn't fully aware of what a Singleton pattern\n",
    "does) might think he was creating a new instance, \n",
    "which could lead to very unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, overall, it is felt that it is better to make things clearer\n",
    "by requiring the call of a class method that is defined in\n",
    "Singleton. An attempt to instantiate via S() will result \n",
    "in a SingletonException being raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Use __S.__init__() for instantiation processing,\n",
    "since S.getInstance() runs S.__init__(), passing it the args it has received. \n",
    "\n",
    "If no data needs to be passed in at instantiation time, you don't need S.__init__().\n",
    "\n",
    "4) If S.__init__(.) requires parameters, include them ONLY in the\n",
    "first call to S.getInstance(). If subsequent calls have arguments,\n",
    "a SingletonException is raised by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find it more convenient for subsequent calls to be allowed to\n",
    "have arguments, but for those argumentsto be ignored, just include \n",
    "'ignoreSubsequent = True' in your class definition, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "  class S(Singleton):\n",
    "  \n",
    "      ignoreSubsequent = True\n",
    "\n",
    "      def __init__(self, a, b=1):\n",
    "          pass\n",
    "\n",
    "5) For testing, it is sometimes convenient for all existing singleton\n",
    "instances to be forgotten, so that new instantiations can occur. For that\n",
    "reason, a forgetAllSingletons() function is included. Just call\n",
    "\n",
    "  forgetAllSingletons()\n",
    "  \n",
    "and it is as if no earlier instantiations have occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) As an implementation detail, classes that inherit \n",
    "from Singleton may not have their own __new__\n",
    "methods. To make sure this requirement is followed, \n",
    "an exception is raised if a Singleton subclass includ\n",
    "es __new__. This happens at subclass instantiation\n",
    "time (by means of the MetaSingleton metaclass.\n",
