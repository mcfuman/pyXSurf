# pyXTel
Python library for X-Ray Optics, Metrology Data Analysis and Telescopes Design.

## Installation
Download or fork the project in a folder accessible on your system.

## Status
This is a release version, modules under preliminary development are excluded. I am using my beginner skills with github to keeo it self-consistent.
First version of repository includes a lot of scripts that are not essential or well commented. 
**TODO:** remove unessential files. Learn how to add documentation from docstring.

## Modules

A basic description of the different modules is:
* **dataIO**
Generic routines for accessing and manipulating data.
* **notebooks**
Jupyter notebooks, not necessarily related to the libraries, include test and experiments on python.
* **plotting**
Plotting functions for pySurf data.
* **pyGeo3D**
Functions for geometry in space (lines and planes).
* **pyProfile**
Equivalent of pySurf acting on Profiles.
* **pySurf**
Functions and classes acting on 3D points or surfaces.
* **thermal**
Functions for modelling of thermal forming of glass.

Some examples and data can be found in a `test` subfolder of each module.
