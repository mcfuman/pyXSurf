## Installation

Download or fork the project in a folder accessible on your system.

## Modules
For each module there are examples and data in a `test` subfolder.
This is a release version, modules under preliminary development are excluded. I am using my beginner skills with github to keeo it self-consistent.

List of modules included:
### dataIO
Generic routines for accessing and manipulating data.
### pySurf
Functions and classes acting on 3D points or surfaces.
### pyProfile
Equivalent of pySurf acting on Profiles.
### plotting
Plotting functions for pySurf

### notebooks
Jupyter notebooks, not necessarily related to the libraries, include test and experiments on python.
